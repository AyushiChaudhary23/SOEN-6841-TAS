\chapter{Abstract}

This extensive research digs into the difficult area of decision-making under uncertainty, with a special emphasis on its importance in the field of software engineering. The article explores the issues that software engineers encounter when faced with insufficient or contradictory information and provides a systematic framework to help them make successful decisions in such situations. The framework's goal is to give software engineering students and professionals with a practical guide to navigating uncertainty, consequently increasing decision-making skills and contributing to the success of software projects.

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}

The inspiration for researching the subject of coping with uncertainty in software engineering stems from the daily experiences of software engineering students and professionals. Uncertainty is an ever-present factor in the dynamic and continuously growing world of software development. Software developers frequently face scenarios in which judgements must be made in the absence of comprehensive or consistent facts. These decisions frequently have far-reaching consequences, influencing the quality, timeliness, and success of software initiatives. Understanding how to cope with uncertainty successfully is not just desirable; it is required for the growth and stability of the software engineering sector.
\\
Uncertainty is particularly difficult in software engineering because software systems are intangible, sophisticated, and prone to continuous change. It's an area where precision and accuracy are critical, and minor mistakes or miscalculations can have serious effects, such as project delays, budget overruns, and unsatisfied stakeholders.
